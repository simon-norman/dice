# Dice app

## Overview

This is a dice rolling app for the first week of the Maker's Academy course.
The app is able to roll 1 or more 6-sided dice and return the results (the
individual dice rolls).

## Approach

I used TDD to create a test suite from the user stories, following the
Red -> Green -> Refactor process. The app is written in Ruby, using Rspec for
testing.
